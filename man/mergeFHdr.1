.SH FILES
The two mandatory command line arguments are a FITS file which
will be edited and an ASCII file with FITS header cards
in the cfitsio template style. The template style means a file contains
a keyword, an equal sign, a value, a slash and a comment.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The python3 program assumes that the astropy python package is available.
It opens the file.fits in read/write mode and the ASCII file cards.hdr in read mode.
Each line in cards.hdr is inserted in the primary header data unit (PHDU)
of the FITS file, using the equal sign and the slash to split the
line into keyord, value, and comment.
